## Getting Things Done: My take aways and what works for me

Getting Things Done by ... is a great book. What I liked

* easy to follow
* can apply it right away
* has been useful for both work and personal
* takes dedication
* finding the right tool can be distracting
* easy to relapse
* use it more when i'm swamped and not sure where to start


* key is whenever i need to do something i write it down. big or small. if i can't break it down now, do it later (but you gotta do it later)
* make the to do small and specific enough you can do it in 5 min. don't write clean apartment, write move papers on table into pile. so stakes are low, time is saved and you can do it if you only have 5 min. then you can have another task dependent on that saying, look through papers to throw away unneccessary ones, etc.
* I find it super useful when i have personal things to get done but also when trying to implement a story and write small modular TDD code. What is the smallest thing i can do to get this done. WHat can i do right now that i can finish?
